But a check-in before 11:00 am it is never possible.\n\n• And we do not have a storage room, because we do not have a reception, so unfortunately it is not possible to put your luggage before check-in into the apartment. \n\n• PLEASE DO NOT BOOK THE APARTMENT IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THIS CHECK-IN RULES!!!\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n•  Please take note that in Germany it may become rather cold in winter. It is true that you live in a historic house dating from the early years of the last century, but nevertheless the house is equipped with an ultramodern central gas heating, so that at any time the statutory minimum temperature (and even higher than that) can be kept, meaning temperatures of more than 20-22 degrees Celsius during the day and of more than 18 degrees at night.\n\n•  You will find detailed information concerning the central heating and habits in Germany at the end of the house rules. It is important to read these especially carefully if you are sensitive to cold.\n\n•  PLEASE DO NOT BOOK THE APARTMENT IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THIS HEATING RULES!!!\n\n•  Unfortunately my apartment may not be safe (enough) or suitable for children and especially not for infants (under 2 years). If you still arrive with infants, we cannot accept the booking and we must cancel the booking for security reasons.\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n• Bitte nehmen Sie sich die Zeit, alle Hausregeln aufmerksam und vollständig zu lesen. Für eine deutsche Übersetzung der Hausregeln wählen Sie bitte auf der Airbnb Seite die Sprache “Deutsch“ und klicken im Beschreibungstext auf „Mehr über die Unterkunft lesen“ und lesen dort unter „Weitere wichtige Infos“ die Hausregeln in der deutschen Übersetzung nach.\n\n• Please take the time to read all the house rules carefully and completely. For a German translation please choose the language \"German\" on the site of Airbnb and there click on the button \"Mehr über die Unterkunft lesen\" and then please read the house rules in the German translation under the heading \"Weitere wichtige Informationen\".\n\n• Show consideration for our (very sensitive) neighbours and the other guests!!!\n\n• The usual times of quiet are to be kept absolutely, this means after 20:00 hours only low volume and after 22:00 hours only such a volume which does NOT IN ANY WAY disturb or molest other occupants\n\n• It is NOT PERMITTED to listen to music or to watch television after 22:00 hours with windows open.\n\n• Please take care not to have any loud discussions or talks after 22:00 hours with windows open.\n\n• Non-smoking area in the whole house, including windows and backyard and garden.\n\n• After 22.00 hours and in winter with ice and snow take off your shoes (house shoes, stockings are ok).\n\n• Please handle the apartment, the furnishings and the equipment with care and avoid damages and heavy soiling. The cleaning that takes more than the usual time will be charged with Euro 25,-  per hour, damaged objects with the price of a new replacement or, if older than two years, according to current value or repairs according to actual costs.\n\n• Please do not lose any keys, to obtain a new security key is expensive and requires a lot of time and effort. The loss of the front door key is charged with Euro 75,- each; the loss of the key to the apartment is charged with Euro 125,- because the lock has to be changed and the keys replaced. The guest is at liberty to prove lower damage.\n\n• The kitchen is intended for cooking as is usual in Germany, please avoid smell-intensive and above all smoke-intensive modes of preparation such as frying and deep frying with a more than average production of smoke.\n\n• The apartments are equipped with smoke detectors; if there is an activation of the alarm caused unnecessarily by the guest, for example by smoking in the apartment, this will  be a reason for immediate cancellation without further notice and money already paid will not be refunded. Additionally a fee of Euro 100,- is charged for handling.\n\n• On arrival please hold ready a valid travel document of all guests (identity card or passport, no driver license, student card or similar papers).\n\n• During the heating period: turn off the heating when windows are open, please do inrush airing at least twice a day for 3 -10 minutes, do not put anything on the radiators, do not tilt the windows, open the door of the room when airing.\n\n• No filesharing, illegal up- and downloads or other illegal activities in the internet.\n\n• No professional activities such as massages, escort services or similar activities.\n\n• The apartment is NOT suitable for infants (under 2 years), if there is a booking with children of that age we reserve the right to cancel the booking. On arrival with children of this age contrary to our house rules we reserve the right to refuse the check-in.\n\n• On arrival please hold ready a valid travel document of all guests (only identity card or passport; but no driver license, student card or similar papers).\n\n• Please agree with us on a fixed time for the check-in as we are not on the spot the whole day. In this way waiting times can be avoided.\n\n• Late arrivals after 23:00 hours have absolutely to be asked for before the booking and must be confirmed by us. Otherwise we may not be able to accept the booking and we keep the right to cancel the booking.\n\n• All prices include all taxes. If you need an invoice, please ask for it directly at Airbnb because they also do the payment process, therefore we are not able to write an invoice.\n\n---------------------------------------\n\nDetailed information concerning the central heating and habits in Germany:\n\nThe modern central heating system is equipped with external sensors so that the heating power is adapted to outside temperatures. At night temperatures are lowered in the same way.\n\nThis may mean among other things that if it is much too warm for the time of year (as was the case this winter 2023/2024 for example), the radiators do not get so hot as you might expect. The same applies to nights.\n\nHowever, this is not a defect of the heating system, but it is constructed like this to achieve this effect.\n\nFor reasons of saving energy and for the protection of our environment temperatures higher than 25 degrees Celsius are not possible in our house.\n\nIf you wish to stay in the apartment only in T-shirt and/or underwear in winter as well, I wish to point out to you that in this case you might not find it warm enough and so I suggest that you do not to book my apartment.\n\nEspecially if you are used to temperatures of 30 degrees Celsius or even higher, you will have to put on warm clothes in the apartment, which means a top with long sleeves and long trousers, possibly made of especially warm material, should you be especially sensitive to cold.\n\nThis is usual in Germany and can also be expected.","accessibility_features":[],"locale_details":{"language":"en","currency":"USD","timezone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"seo":{"og_tags":{"title":"Apartment Motzstraße (1003) with separate bedroom","description":"","image":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/e9c39c11-f24a-4d13-9e2d-81f77ec9dcff.jpg"},"canonical_url":"https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/22382672"}}
