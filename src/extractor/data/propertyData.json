Less than 10 minute walk to the square with many cafes, restaurants, and a couple good sized grocery store nearby. It was so nice to be in an apartment that’s set up so well you comfortably use the entire space.    You actually can sit on the couch and not have your rear end want to go numb after only a short bit.  There are huge windows with lots of natural<br/>light and a nice balcony.  The are also blackout shades in the bedroom if you want to sleep in.  Our host helped us out with all our questions and we couldn’t be happier about our stay.","rating":5,"highlight":"Stayed a few nights","period":"May 2023","reviewer":{"id":"46923949","name":"","photo":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/User-46923949/original/39762a09-6def-45e8-9ce9-c2a5f3baa6f2.jpeg"},"response":"Dear friends, thanks a lot for your kind words 🙂<br/>We're glad that you were satisfied of our apartment and appreciate too much that you found the time to share your experience with us.<br/>You're always welcome in our apartment as good friends 😊","createdAt":"2023-05-30T13:32:06Z"},{"id":"899873870323284273","language":"en","comments":"Eris is a very good host.  He guided us very well from the beginning to the end of our stay.  The house is very spacious and just as it looks in the pictures.  The location was perfect.
