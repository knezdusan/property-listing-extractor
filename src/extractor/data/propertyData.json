We highly recommend getting out and exploring the city on foot. One pleasant route is to walk west from the apartment to Skenderbeg Square -- which should take about five minutes -- and then to head south through the Square, past the great mounted statue of the national hero Skenderbeg, and down the boulevard to the enormous oasis at the heart of the city, Parku i Madh. If you're in the mood for a stroll walk around the lake (Liqeni) in the middle of the park, then head west once you come back out on the Boulevard to check out the vibrant nightlife of the Bllok."}]}},"host":{"id":"RGVtYW5kVXNlcjo3Njc2MTM0Ng==","name":"Saimir","is_superhost":true,"verification_status":["identity_verified","superhost"],"languages_spoken":["English","Italian"],"contact_methods":["airbnb_message"],"years_hosting":5,"avatar":{"url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/231fac69-fcc6-4f23-8395-1803db3f0deb.jpg","accessibility_label":"Profile
