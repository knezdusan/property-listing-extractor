A rural retreat just 10 minutes from Suffolk’s heritage coast. Please note this has an outdoor bath - better than a hot tub as you can use fresh water every soak, with no chemicals. <br /><br />The cabin features:  <br /><br />- A completely private outdoor bath, for 24/7 outdoor soaking.<br />- King bed (with Eve© memory foam mattress).  <br />- Completely plumbed en-suite with toilet, rainfall shower and sink. <br />- Dog friendly walks across the farm. <br />- Meet our pigs.<br /><br /><b>The space</b><br />Your cabin is completely self contained in its own private space. <br /><br />The outdoor roll top bath - an amazing experience which, unlike a hot tub uses fresh water for every soak and no heating time - sits atop a secluded decking and lawn overlooking the hedgerows and fields. It's an unrivalled way to reset your system in nature. You can also enjoy cold soaks for those Wim Hof fans!<br /><br />The cabin provides an off-grid experience without compromising on essentials for cooking and bathing. Dual hobs and kitchen necessities with a luxury, properly plumbed bathroom allow you to get away from the daily distraction of T.V and wi-fi without compromising on comfort.<br /><br />A woodburner and linen yard bedding creates the perfect cosy getaway.<br /><br /><b>Guest access</b><br />We have lots of free parking in the farmyard and the cabin is a short walk across the meadow from where you park.<br /><br />What makes the farm so peaceful is it’s remote location down country lanes. That said, it’s just 10 miles to the heritage coastline with beautiful seaside towns like Aldeburgh and Southwold on your doorstep.<br /><br />There is a pretty walk across the fields to the local pub (35 minute walk) and plenty more in cycling/driving distance.<br /><br />We keep grass margins around all of our fields so you can have a wander and meet our pedigree pigs, horses and Guinea fowl. We often have wild deer and foxes roaming the farm which guests often get to see on an evening stroll.<br /><br /><b>Other things to note</b><br />On your decking is a beautiful roll top bath for long hot soaks in the fresh air. <br /><br />We provide you with plenty of wood for your stove and the kitchenette has the essentials for a meal.","average_daily_rate":177.02932203389827,"tags":["Shepherds hut","Area vibes","Near a Winery","Near a national park","Farm Stay","Tiny house","Cabin"]},"location":{"city":"Suffolk","state":"England","country":"GB","coordinates":"52.2502,1.44382","details":[{"title":"Neighbourhood highlights","content":"Upper Grove Farm is set with bucolic English countryside.

Decking was covered in leaves and had a hole in it which I tripped in but this didn’t really bother us but just something to bear in mind as when you get out the bath it’s hard to not get dirty again and can’t really see hole. Bed was spotless and super comfy. However shower was piping hot and couldn’t adjust temp. Kitchen lovely also. But one thing I would say is the unforeseen costs so if we wanted to light the fire we had to pay for logs and fire starters which was quite inconvenient as for the price we paid you’d assume this was included. There were 2 mostly burnt logs in the log burner but couldn’t light without fire starters and they burnt very quickly also so this was a downside for me.

We used the self check-in option and even though we never met Ben, the instructions sent ahead with directions and everything we’d need during our stay (including a guidebook with food recs and to-do’s nearby) were super helpful. <br/>It was a lovely fall weekend, and despite being such a large farm it was quiet, tranquil, and exactly what we’re hoping for to get away, relax and recharge. <br/>If you’re looking for something in the beautiful Suffolk countryside Ben’s place has everything you could need. We’re already planning our next trip.","rating":5,"highlight":"","period":"October 2023","reviewer":{"id":"437520339","name":"Raquel","photo":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/3bfa6717-82f5-47fa-bc51-b9d1267011fa.jpg"},"response":"","createdAt":"2023-10-08T12:44:30Z"},{"id":"987517714930495696","language":"en","comments":"Lovely, home from home, bolt hole in the country.<br/>The hut is beautifully rustic, with everything you need and added luxuries.

Bigger than expected but also small and intimate at the same time. It’s clearly been made with a lot of thought, love and consideration. So many smart and great uses of space. The bath was lovely, but takes a good 20 mins to fill up so give yourself plenty of time to get it ready. We are at Poachers Pocket on the first night as cannot recommend it enough. Saturday we spent the day at Southwold,  then after checking out Sunday we went to Framingham and then Aldeburgh. We didn’t walk to the pub nearest to the farm, it looked quite far along narrow dark country paths and didn’t trust ourselves to get back 😂<br/>We loved the cabin and definitely want to come back.

The setting was beautiful and so peaceful. The cart was clean and had everything we needed, we even had a welcome drink left for us (thanks this was a great touch). Lovely walks, especially when you have a dog with you. The bath tub added that extra bit of luxury to the stay. We wouldn’t hesitate to book again.","rating":5,"highlight":"","period":"August 2022","reviewer":{"id":"124852333","name":"Hayley","photo":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/02fabe69-6df6-45b7-b8d4-a7c195fde4c1.jpg"},"response":"","createdAt":"2022-08-21T12:06:50Z"},{"id":"689639669001749675","language":"en","comments":"Amazing stay at the farm - such a cute cabin, really well equipped and lots of lovely little touches!
