Hosts are kind and available. <br/>Take into account that there is no cell service and theWiFi most of the time did not work and the parking for the car is far from the apartment- there is a walk of about 200 meters on a sharp rise. The only road trip that goes to the property requires a toll which is not specified in advance. The cleanliness was good overall but the dishes in the kitchen required extra cleaning.
