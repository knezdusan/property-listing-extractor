Gives you a great taste of what life in Northern Italy is like. Very spacious and nice area to sit outside. Our kids were able to play and be at ease. It is about a 30 min walk to the main beach and city center, but there is a beach within a 10 min walk that is nice and not crowded. I recommend driving everywhere else as some of the areas don’t have sidewalks. There is a large, two-lane shared sidewalk (walkers/bikers) on the road in front, but it ends at certain points along the route. The nearest playground is a 30 min walk, if you have kids. Also, if you are planning to do laundry, during the summer the humidity makes it impossible to dry, but we found a great laundromat in Stresa where you can wash and dry one load of laundry in less than an hour. Overall, this place is definitely worth a visit!

Clean, well-kept accommodation. As a welcome, there was a richly stocked vegetable basket from the private garden. On site there is a well-stocked information brochure. We couldn't speak Italian, but we were still able to communicate. If we missed anything, Lodana responded immediately and made everything possible for us. Very very nice ! The driveway is narrow and you should be able to drive reasonably well:)","rating":5,"highlight":"","period":"September 2022","reviewer":{"id":"28558336","name":"Shanice","photo":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/4a46a03e-b3bc-4bae-83ad-7453a3f33d96.jpg"},"response":"","createdAt":"2022-09-20T11:58:34Z"},{"id":"716440882770625814","language":"de","comments":"We felt very comfortable with Lodana and Lele and were warmly welcomed by everyone including the cats. The location is great, the house is very close to the lake without having to climb too many steps and by car it is no problem anyway. <br/>A very nice beach with kiosk and lifeguard is only a 5-minute walk away, and restaurants in Suna, for example, are also within walking distance.<br/>Shops like Lidl are also a few minutes away by car and you can reach the Val Grande for a hike in 35 minutes.","rating":5,"highlight":"","period":"September 2022","reviewer":{"id":"441331344","name":"Hannah Schleper","photo":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/User/original/f0164321-6dea-4b8c-bf42-a1bcfa27f5ac.jpeg"},"response":"","createdAt":"2022-09-15T12:00:08Z"},{"id":"712862032557536336","language":"en","comments":"Great place to stay!! If you are looking for a comfy apartment with an amazing view and lovely hosts look no further. 5 min walk to a small beach with a little kiosk and 10 min drive to the next big city with supermarkets and restaurants. The hosts are super lovely and we got a basket full of fresh vegetables from their garden when we arrived. The kitchen is super equipped so you can cook. The owners have sweet cats which sometimes come and visit :) the check in was super easy and the owners are very friendly.

A perfect welcome (despite our late arrival). Listing as advertised. Small downside (because you still need it!) the very busy and a little noisy nearby road but it didn't really bother us, lack of comfort for the sofa mattress and pillows. Very nice hosts, available and good advice, perfect communication.  A great view of the lake and its islands , ideal location to visit most of the lagoon maggiorre.  Thank you so much for everything.","rating":5,"highlight":"","period":"August 2022","reviewer":{"id":"121910599","name":"Alexandre","photo":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/User-121910599/original/a8794316-5f8e-40e0-a05d-eb6fcf0ccaff.jpeg"},"response":"","createdAt":"2022-08-17T14:31:04Z"},{"id":"692570159448569500","language":"de","comments":"We booked for two days at very short notice.

The apartment is clean and you have your own parking space on the property that you share with other residents. The apartment was clean and conveniently furnished, so there were four of us staying there well.","rating":4,"highlight":"","period":"August 2022","reviewer":{"id":"446008093","name":"Sven","photo":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/b406cd6d-06fe-45b0-ba9f-c8437cd483ba.jpg"},"response":"","createdAt":"2022-08-13T13:33:16Z"},{"id":"691107090230831967","language":"fr","comments":"Exceptional view and hospitality.<br/>Location on Lake Maggiore top.
