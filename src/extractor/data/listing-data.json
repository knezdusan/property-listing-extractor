The A/C is extremely loud, but it's effecient so we didn't need to use it during a long period of time. The code system is really convenient and the essentials cabinet is handy too.

Nice sipping coffee in the morning watching joggers in South Cove Park and the boats on the river. I actually didn’t know that this was a hotel when i booked. I thought it was apartment buildings. The rooftop was very nice. I enjoyed the night view in this beautiful green space while drinking Montauk beer. Kitchen was very nice and modern. The best area of the unit. A few fails, the spout from shower was coming out of the wall. Looked like bad repair. The corner window sills were dirty dusty where there was no access to it. Bed headboard had a stain and some hair in the area. Overall, i would give them another chance and stay here again.

After 1.5 hours of messaging and phoning, they told me the best I could get is a refund after 5-7 days. 8pm in Manhattan on a Friday night without a place to stay after a long day of travel is far from ideal.
